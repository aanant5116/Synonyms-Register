# Synonyms-Register


Database Setup:
Set up a MySQL database to store synonyms. Create a table with columns like id, word, and synonym.
Ensure that the database can enforce uniqueness of pairs (word, synonym) to avoid duplicates.

API Endpoints:
Create API endpoints to handle synonym registration and retrieval.
For registration, the API should accept a POST request with JSON payload containing a "word" and its "synonym."
For retrieval, the API should accept a GET request with a word as a parameter and return its synonyms.

Transitive Rule Implementation:
Implement a mechanism to enforce the transitive rule. When registering a synonym, ensure that if "B" is a synonym for "A," and "C" is a synonym for "B," then "C" should also be considered a synonym for "A."
You may achieve this by updating the database records during synonym registration or by dynamically calculating transitive synonyms during retrieval.

Error Handling:
Implement proper error handling to manage cases where the input data is incomplete, invalid, or the database operations fail.

Documentation:
Document your API, providing clear information on how to use each endpoint, expected request formats, and response structures.
Include information about the transitive rule and any other specific behavior of your API.

Testing:
Conduct thorough testing of your API. Test cases should cover normal usage scenarios as well as edge cases, ensuring the correct functioning of the transitive rule.

Deployment:
Deploy your API and ensure it is accessible to the intended users. Consider using a web server or platform that supports your chosen technology stack.

Monitoring and Maintenance:
Set up monitoring for your API to track performance, errors, and usage patterns.
Plan for ongoing maintenance, including database backups, updates, and scaling as needed.

Scalability:
Design your API to be scalable, considering potential increases in data volume and user traffic.
